## 🛠 Features
- **Single Tap (< 300ms)** → Toggles **Caps Lock** state.

1. **PowerToys** – To remap Caps Lock to Ctrl.
2. **AutoHotkey** – Handles short-tap Caps Lock toggle.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Download this program** and run it.
2. **Enable Auto Start on Windows** for persistence.
3. **Enjoy an optimized Caps Lock key!**
